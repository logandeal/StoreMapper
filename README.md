# Features
  - When run, the program will execute a text menu from which the user will be prompted to either add an item to their shopping list, remove an item from their shopping list, view their current shopping list, find the shortest path through the grocery store while getting every item on their list, and exit the program. 
  
  - If the user chooses to add an item to their shopping list, another text menu will be displayed, from which they will be given a list of items that are in the grocery store that they could choose from.
  
  - Removing an item from their shopping works identically to adding an item, but the items displayed will be the items currently in the shopping list.
  
  - Viewing the current shopping list prints out every item in the current shopping list
  
  - If the user chooses to find the shortest path through the grocery store, they will be given a choice of multiple different search algorithms that would search through the store.
